Usage instructions: 
You will need to create a "out.txt" and a "model.pth" file in your directory before running the program. Also make sure "tgas_constrained.pkl" is in the directory.
Adjust hyperparameters and file/output settings in "hyperparameters.py". Toggle hyperparameters.saveModel = True to save the final selected model.
